# 14 — Change log

## Module 01 — Foundation, Architecture & Design System

### Added

**Backend (Laravel 12.69.1, PHP 8.4)**
- `/api/v1` route structure with a `Route::fallback()` that answers in the error contract
- `ApiResponse` envelope: `ok`, `created`, `noContent`, `paginated`, `error`
- `ApiErrorCode` (11 codes) and `ApiException` with named constructors
- `ApiExceptionRenderer` — one contract for every throwable; 5xx never self-describes
- `AssignRequestId`, `SecureHeaders`, `LogApiRequests`, `EnforceIdempotency` middleware
- `StructuredFormatter` / `StructuredLogger` — JSON logs with depth-bounded redaction
- `Role` enum (7 roles) with surface routing
- `ProductionConfigGuard` — refuses to boot a misconfigured staging/production
- `HealthController` (live + ready) and `MetaController`
- `users` migration establishing the database conventions; `User` model
- `config/foodonthego.php`, `config/cors.php`, `pint.json`, `.env.example`
- 67 tests

**Web (React 19, TypeScript 5.7, Vite 6)**
- `@fotg/ui`: design tokens, base styles, primitives, `AppShell`, API client, health hook
- `@fotg/restaurant`: 11-area dashboard shell
- `@fotg/admin`: 14-area admin shell, including a live **System Health** page
- 29 tests

**Mobile (Flutter 3.47.2, Dart 3.13)**
- `core/theme`: tokens, typography, light and dark themes
- `core/router`: `FotgAppShell` with five destinations over an `IndexedStack`
- `features/`: home plus four placeholder screens
- `shared/widgets`: `ModulePlaceholder`, `FotgCard`
- `web/flutter_bootstrap.js` self-hosting CanvasKit
- 19 tests

**Docs** — 15 documents.
**CI** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for backend, web and Flutter.

### Removed

The repository previously contained a **different product on a different stack**: a generic
food-delivery app (Fastify + SQLite + a React storefront), built before the route-based product
definition and the Laravel/MySQL/Flutter architecture were specified. It was removed wholesale
rather than adapted — the domain and the stack both differ. It remains in git history and in the
pull request that introduced it.

### Fixed

Thirteen defects found during Module 01, listed with root causes in
[13-known-issues.md](13-known-issues.md). The ones worth repeating:

- A WCAG AA contrast failure in the brand palette (3.31:1) — caught by a test that computes the ratio
- A CORS misconfiguration that blocked every browser request — caught by live browser inspection
- A catch-all route that made 405 impossible and shadowed later routes
- A topbar that only fitted while the API was up
